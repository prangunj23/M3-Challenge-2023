# M3 Modelworks Math Modeling Challenge

This is a collection of the work done for the M3 Modelworks 2023 Math Modeling Challenge. This competition looks to test the modeling skills of high school students by providing some preliminary data regarding a certain topic and then asking some questions regarding that data set. This years challenge tackled the circumstances surrounding E-Bike sales. We were provided a variety of data, ranging from E-Bike sales over time in multiple countries, to gas prices and battery efficiency metrics over time. A link to the official problem statement can be found [here](https://m3challenge.siam.org/sites/default/files/uploads/M3%20Challenge%20PROBLEM_2023.pdf).
