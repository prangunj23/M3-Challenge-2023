# M3 Modelworks Math Modeling Challenge

This is a collection of the work done for the M3 Modelworks 2023 Math Modeling Challenge. This competition looks to test the modeling skills of high school students by providing some preliminary data regarding a certain topic and then asking some questions regarding that data set. This years challenge tackled the circumstances surrounding E-Bike sales. We were provided a variety of data, ranging from E-Bike sales over time in multiple countries, to gas prices and battery efficiency metrics over time. A link to the official problem statement can be found [here](https://m3challenge.siam.org/sites/default/files/uploads/M3%20Challenge%20PROBLEM_2023.pdf). 

1. Question 1: The Road Ahead
    - This question asked us to build a model to predict the growth in E-Bike sales that will be sold two and five years from now.
    - To answer this question, we decided to build two regression models, a linear and an exponential model. We used MATLAB to format the data and then we used the curve-fit function to construct our model.
2. Question 2: Shifting Gears
    - Temp
    - Temp
3. Question 3: Off the Chain
    - Temp
    - Temp
